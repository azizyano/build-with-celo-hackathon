### Project Description

#### Game description

![dart board](https://github.com/azizyano/build-with-celo-hackathon/blob/main/Arrow_Catch/project/components/assets/dart_board.png)

the NFT description :

`{

    "name":"SVG NFT",

    "description":"archery shooting random",

    "attributes":"radius ,angle" ,

    "image":"imageURI"

}`

using radius and angle as attributes you can calculate your point. point = angle(id) / radius. the last thing you need to do is to offer an amount so anyone can challenge you.

2 - You can challenge players by selecting their NFTs and try to mint a new one that has more points. if you win you will receive the amount offered, if you lose you will lose the amount fee.
