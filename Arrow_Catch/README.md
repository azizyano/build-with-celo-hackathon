#### Project Description
Arrow catch is a Two-player NFT game. 

(contract deployed in CELO testnet)

## Game description
to join the game you have Tow options:
- mint on-chain NFT, the contract games will generate a random position on the dart board.
![dart board](https://github.com/azizyano/build-with-celo-hackathon/blob/main/Arrow_Catch/project/components/assets/dart_board.png)

the NFT description :
`
{
    "name":"SVG NFT",
    "description":"archery shooting random",
    "attributes":"radius ,angle ,
    "image":"imageURI"
}       
`
using radius and angle as attributes you can calculate your point. point = angle(id) / radius. the last thing you need to do is to offer an amount so anyone can challenge you.

- you can challenge players by selecting their NFTs and try to mint a new one that has more points. if you win you will receive the amount offered, if you lose you will lose the amount fee.
